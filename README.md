# README

This is a github demo!

## 1. Clone the Repository
Forking allows you to create a personal copy of the repository, while cloning creates a local copy on your computer. The link to the repository may be obtained through the green button "code" and you may use the Git command: 'git clone <repository-link>'

## 2. New Branches
A new branch can be created with command: 'git branch <branch-name>'. Then you may switch to the new branch using 'git checkout <branch-name>'. 

## 3. Add and Commit
Check the status of your changes using comand 'git status', and add the modified files with 'add <file1> <file2> ...' or simply 'add .' to add all of the files. Check the status again to ensure all changes are staged 'git status'. Then commit the changes to your branch using 'git commit -m "updaded readme"' Don't forget to add the commit message!

Push the changes onto github using 'git push'.
